Statement of Problem
This dashboard seeks to optimize bike sales by gaining insights into regional preferences and commute routes, salaries etc. To achieve this, we need to develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides a detailed analysis of bike sales data, focusing on regional trends and popular commute routes. 

INSIGHTS

(1) The average income of males purchasing our bike is reported as $60,124. The average income of females purchasing our bike is reported as $55,774

It is evident that there's a notable discrepancy in the average income between male and female customers. Specifically, the average income of male purchasers stands at $60,124, whereas female purchasers exhibit a slightly lower average income of $55,774. This contrast underscores the potential for targeted marketing strategies tailored to each demographic, ensuring our products resonate effectively with diverse consumer segments.

(2)Our analysis reveals a clear trend in bike purchases across age demographics, with middle-aged individuals emerging as the primary consumer group. Specifically, we observe a substantial count of 383 purchases made by individuals within this age bracket. In contrast, adolescents represent a smaller portion of our customer base, with a count of only 31 purchases, while individuals in the older age bracket account for 59 purchases.

Given the significant prevalence of middle-aged customers, efforts should be directed towards catering to their specific needs and preferences, potentially focusing on features that appeal to this demographic's lifestyle and interests. Additionally, targeted campaigns aimed at increasing adolescent and older age group engagement may present opportunities for expanding our market reach and diversifying our customer base.

(3) A detailed examination of commuting distances among our bike purchasers reveals intriguing patterns in consumer behavior. Notably, a significant proportion of customers reside within a short commuting distance of 0-1 miles, with 200 bikes purchased for such short trips. Following closely, the 1-2 mile commuting range registers 152 purchases, suggesting a continued preference for biking among individuals within relatively close proximity to their destinations.
However, as commuting distances increase, we observe a gradual decline in bike purchases. Within the 2-5 mile range, 95 bikes were sold, indicating a willingness among some consumers to utilize bikes for slightly longer journeys. This trend persists as we move into the 5-10 mile range, with 76 bikes purchased, albeit at a reduced frequency compared to shorter distances.Interestingly, the number of purchases declines notably for distances exceeding 10 miles, with only 33 bikes bought for such longer commutes

Understanding these commuting patterns allows us to tailor our marketing efforts and product offerings accordingly. By emphasizing the convenience and practicality of biking for short to moderate distances, we can effectively target segments of our customer base while also exploring opportunities to address challenges associated with longer commutes, potentially through product enhancements or supplementary services.

(4)Our analysis of bike purchases across different regions highlights distinctive consumer preferences and market dynamics, with notable variations in sales volumes observed among key regions. 

Specifically, North America emerges as a robust market, with 200 bikes sold in this region, reflecting a strong demand for our products and a significant consumer base engaged in cycling activities.
In Europe, we observe a slightly lower but still substantial sales figure, with 148 bikes purchased. This indicates a considerable presence and interest in our bikes within the European market.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific region, we note 113 bike purchases, suggesting a moderate yet noteworthy level of engagement with our products among consumers in this area.
